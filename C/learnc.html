            <p>C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.</p>
            
            <p>C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix. Later, it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. Nowadays, it is one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 and subsequently by the International Organization for Standardization.</p>

            <p>'C' is a base language for many programming languages. So, learning 'C' as the main language will play an important role while studying other programming languages. It shares the same concepts such as data types, operators, control statements and many more. 'C' can be used widely in various applications. It is a simple language and provides faster execution. There are many jobs available for a 'C' developer in the current market.        </p>
          <p>'C' is a structured programming language in which program is divided into various modules. Each module can be written separately and together it forms a single 'C' program. This structure makes it easy for testing, maintaining and debugging processes.
      
      'C' contains 32 keywords, various data types and a set of powerful built-in functions that make programming very efficient.
      
      Another feature of 'C' programming is that it can extend itself. A 'C' program contains various functions which are part of a library. We can add our features and functions to the library. We can access and use these functions anytime we want in our program. This feature makes it simple while working with complex programming.
      
      Various compilers are available in the market that can be used for executing programs written in this language.
      
      It is a highly portable language which means programs written in 'C' language can run on other machines. This feature is essential if we wish to use or execute the code on another computer.</p>

        <p>C is a compiled language. A compiler is a special tool that compiles the program and converts it into the object file which is machine readable. After the compilation process, the linker will combine different object files and creates a single executable file to run the program. The following diagram shows the execution of a 'C' program</p>
            <p>Nowadays, various compilers are available online, and you can use any of those compilers. The functionality will never differ and most of the compilers will provide the features required to execute both 'C' and 'C++' programs.
      
      Following is the list of popular compilers available online:
      <ul>
        <li>Clang compiler</li>
        <li>MinGW compiler (Minimalist GNU for Windows)</li>
           <li> Portable 'C' compiler</li>
        <li>Turbo C </li> </p>

          <article>
            <p>C supports a rich set of operators, which are symbols used within an expression to specify the manipulations to be performed while evaluating that expression. C has operators for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %</li>
      <li>assignment: =</li>
      <li>augmented assignment: +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=</li>
      <li>bitwise logic: ~, &, |, ^</li>
      <li>bitwise shifts: <<, >></li>
      <li>boolean logic: !, &&, ||</li>
      <li>conditional evaluation: ? :</li>
      <li>equality testing: ==, !=</li>
      <li>calling functions: ( )</li>
      <li>increment and decrement: ++, --</li>
      <li>member selection: ., -></li>
      <li>object size: sizeof</li>
      <li>order relations: <, <=, >, >=</li>
      <li>reference and dereference: &, *, [ ]</li>
      <li>sequencing: ,</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The C operator precedence is not always intuitive. For example, the operator == binds more tightly than (is executed prior to) the operators & (bitwise AND) and | (bitwise OR) in expressions such as x & 1 == 0, which must be written as (x & 1) == 0 if that is the coder's intent.</p>

          <article>
            <p>The type system in C is static and weakly typed, which makes it similar to the type system of ALGOL descendants such as Pascal.[28] There are built-in types for integers of various sizes, both signed and unsigned, floating-point numbers, and enumerated types (enum). Integer type char is often used for single-byte characters. C99 added a boolean datatype. There are also derived types including arrays, pointers, records (struct), and unions (union).</p>
            
            <p>C is often used in low-level systems programming where escapes from the type system may be necessary. The compiler attempts to ensure type correctness of most expressions, but the programmer can override the checks in various ways, either by using a type cast to explicitly convert a value from one type to another, or by using pointers or unions to reinterpret the underlying bits of a data object in some other way. </p>
             
        <p>C's usual arithmetic conversions allow for efficient code to be generated, but can sometimes produce unexpected results. For example, a comparison of signed and unsigned integers of equal width requires a conversion of the signed value to unsigned. This can generate unexpected results if the signed value is negative.</p>

          <article>
           <p> The "hello, world" example, which appeared in the first edition of K&R, has become the model for an introductory program in most programming textbooks, regardless of programming language. The program prints "hello, world" to the standard output, which is usually a terminal or screen display.</p>

              } </code></li>
            <li><p>A standard-conforming "hello, world" program is:</p>

            <article>
              <p>Array types in C are traditionally of a fixed, static size specified at compile time. (The more recent C99 standard also allows a form of variable-length arrays.) However, it is also possible to allocate a block of memory (of arbitrary size) at run-time, using the standard library's malloc function, and treat it as an array. C's unification of arrays and pointers means that declared arrays and these dynamically allocated simulated arrays are virtually interchangeable.</p>
              <p>since arrays are always accessed (in effect) via pointers, array accesses are typically not checked against the underlying array size, although some compilers may provide bounds checking as an option. Array bounds violations are therefore possible and rather common in carelessly written code, and can lead to various repercussions, including illegal memory accesses, corruption of data, buffer overruns, and run-time exceptions. If bounds checking is desired, it must be done manually.</p>
              <ul>
                <li> <p>Syntax:</p><code>data_type array_name[array_size];</code></li>
             <li> <p>Example:</p>
               <code>float mark[5];</code></li>
             <li> <p>Initialisation Of Arrays:</p>
              <p>It's possible to initialize an array during declaration. For example,</p>
               <code>int mark[5] = {19, 10, 8, 17, 9};</code></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Multi-dimensional arrays are commonly used in numerical algorithms (mainly from applied linear algebra) to store matrices. The structure of the C array is well suited to this particular task. However, since arrays are passed merely as pointers, the bounds of the array must be known fixed values or else explicitly passed to any subroutine that requires them, and dynamically sized arrays of arrays cannot be accessed using double indexing. (A workaround for this is to allocate the array with an additional "row vector" of pointers to the columns.)
      
      C99 introduced "variable-length arrays" which address some, but not all, of the issues with ordinary C arrays.</p>

            <article>
              <p>One of the most important functions of a programming language is to provide facilities for managing memory and the objects that are stored in memory. C provides three distinct ways to allocate memory for objects:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Static memory allocation: space for the object is provided in the binary at compile-time; these objects have an extent (or lifetime) as long as the binary which contains them is loaded into memory.</li>
      <li>Automatic memory allocation: temporary objects can be stored on the stack, and this space is automatically freed and reusable after the block in which they are declared is exited.</li>
      <li>Dynamic memory allocation: blocks of memory of arbitrary size can be requested at run-time using library functions such as malloc from a region of memory called the heap; these blocks persist until subsequently freed for reuse by calling the library function realloc or free</li>
              </ul>
        <p>These three approaches are appropriate in different situations and have various trade-offs. For example, static memory allocation has little allocation overhead, automatic allocation may involve slightly more overhead, and dynamic memory allocation can potentially have a great deal of overhead for both allocation and deallocation. The persistent nature of static objects is useful for maintaining state information across function calls, automatic allocation is easy to use but stack space is typically much more limited and transient than either static memory or heap space, and dynamic memory allocation allows convenient allocation of objects whose size is known only at run-time. Most C programs make extensive use of all three.</p>

             <li> <p>C is widely used for system programming in implementing operating systems and embedded system applications, because C code, when written for portability, can be used for most purposes, yet when needed, system-specific code can be used to access specific hardware addresses and to perform type punning to match externally imposed interface requirements, with a low run-time demand on system resources.</p></li>
              <li><p>C can also be used for website programming using CGI as a "gateway" for information between the Web application, the server, and the browser. C is often chosen over interpreted languages because of its speed, stability, and near-universal availability.</p></li>
            <li>  <p>One consequence of C's wide availability and efficiency is that compilers, libraries and interpreters of other programming languages are often implemented in C. The reference implementations of Python, Perl and PHP, for example, are all written in C.</li>
      
      Because the layer of abstraction is thin and the overhead is low, C enables programmers to create efficient implementations of algorithms and data structures, useful for computationally intense programs. For example, the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library, the GNU Scientific Library, Mathematica, and MATLAB are completely or partially written in C.</p>
              <p>C has also been widely used to implement end-user applications. However, such applications can also be written in newer, higher-level languages.</p>
